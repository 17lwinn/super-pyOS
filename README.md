# super Py OS 1.0.3
## The pseudoOS designed to offer an enhanced OS experience alongside your current one

SuperPy is designed to offer a simple and pythonic psuedo-operating-system, offering a simple API to extend it by adding
commands and system services.

# DISCLAIMER

Despite the name and description- this is simply a set of concurrent python scripts programmed to simulate the functions of your household OS. It does not come with a bootloader- which is a requirement for any OS and even so the code would have to be in a language like C.

Therefore **I would strongly advise against attempting to install this as your current OS**, as there is no BIOS or bootloader your computer could be damaged beyond repair/excessive damage to hardware. And I will accept no liability for any damage caused by my/our software.

-----

## installation and usage

Just clone the repo and run main.py! Modules are imported from the PSL (Python Standard Library) so no further installation is required.

The script looks for the core file, then the core looks for the handler and other things. If these are found then the OS 'boots'.

## Our quest

We want to create an open-source pseudoOS for anyone to enjoy, anywhere and everywhere on any operating system with python installed.
